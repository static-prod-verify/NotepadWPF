# .NETpad (C#/WPF version) - Try test 3

![.NETpad hero image](/hero.jpg)

.NETpad is a basic clone of Microsoft Notepad that was created by Paul Thurrott ([@thurrott](https://www.twitter.com/thurrott)) with the help of Rafael Rivera ([@withinrafael](https://www.twitter.com/withinrafael)), several outside contributors, and, thanks to his books, Charles Petzold. This version is slightly more sophisticated than the Windows Forms version, but it could still have bugs. 

.NETpad (WPF) provides most Notepad features, albeit in U.S. English only, and adds a few additional features that Notepad lacks, including:

- Optional auto-save every 30 seconds
- Themes with the ability to arbitrarily choose a new background and text color
- Display scaling - Switch the main applicaton window between 100, 110, 125, 150, and 175 percent scaling
- Word count, displayed in the status bar

[I documented how I created this app on Thurrott.com](https://www.thurrott.com/tag/the-wpf-notepad-project).  I will consider updating this app with some more modern features and bug fixes. 

This version of .NETpad should work on all supported versions of Windows 10 and Windows 11.
